        <p>Introduction: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. What do
            all these states have in common? They all have played pivotal roles in elections for decades. However, not
            many people realize the impact of these battleground states until the most recent elections.

        <h2>What are swing states?</h2>
        <p>To preface, swing states/states could be won by either the Democratic or Republican candidate in an election.
            The seven states listed above have been critical battleground states in the past few elections, mainly for
            presidents. To become president, you must be the first to get 270 votes, as each state has a certain amount
            of electoral votes. Multiple factors can determine who wins in these swing states, such as demographics of
            the states, ages of voters, and population in certain counties. </p>

                <h2>2020 vs. 2024 Election</h2>
                <li-p>In 2020, President Joe Biden won six out of the seven swing states, as he lost North Carolina;
                    however,
                    that changed in the most recent election, as President-elect Donald Trump won all swing states, some
                    by a close
                    margin.</li-p>

                <li-p>According to The Washington Post, Biden won Arizona by 10,000 votes and Georgia by a little under
                    12,000
                    votes. Those swing states were the narrowest compared to others like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But
                    part
                    of the reason that Biden won these swing states was that he was dependent on certain counties and
                    cities
                    with huge populations, such as the Philadelphia Metro and Atlanta.</li-p>

                <li-p>That was not the case this past election, as there
                    was a difference in how most swing states voted, except North Carolina. All swing states voted for
                    Trump in this past election, as he won narrowly in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.</li-p>

        <h2>North Carolina</h2>
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-12-04 at 11.48.09 PM.png" alt="nc" class="img-fluid">
        <p>North Carolina has not been “blue” since 2008, when former president Barack Obama won. In this most recent
            election, many thought they had the chance to flip blue as the rise of blue was up in big cities like
            Raleigh and Charlotte. In 2020, Biden only lost North Carolina by one point compared to 2016, where
            then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lost by four points. North Carolina was close to closing the gap
            and flipping blue; however, in this election, NBC News stated that 57% of men voted Republican, while 54% of
            women voted Democratic. However, the Hispanic vote in North Carolina was 50% for Republicans compared to 49%
            for Democrats. It was also stated that 69% of white people voted for Trump, while 86% of Black people voted
            for Harris. </p>

    <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
        <h2>Why Demographics Matter</h2>
        <p>Like North Carolina, age, race, and population significantly influence who could win each battleground state;
            comparing the 2020 election results to the 2024 election results, Trump was able to contain the white man
            vote and gain the majority of the white women vote as well. As stated by NBC News, 60% of white men voted
            Republican, while 53% of white women voted Republican as well. As far as other racial votes, the majority of
            African Americans leaned Democratic, while 55% of Latino men voted Republican. Regarding age, 49% of males
            between 18 and 29 voted Republican, 53% of men between 30 and 44, 60% of men between 45 and 64, and 55% of
            males 65 and up. Regarding women, only women between 45 and 64 voted Republican, while the other age groups
            leaned more Democratic. </p>
